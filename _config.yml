            3D Agriculture is an impact company fighting hunger and climate change through ultra-low-cost vertical farms. I led an initially independent project, which was eventually incorporated under the 3D Agriculture umbrella. My tasks included (but were not limited to) data wrangling/analysis/clustering, product development, market research and branding.

            Cambridge Cancer Genomics (now acquired by Dante Labs) was a Y-Combinator-backed healthtech startup building tools to enable oncologists to make the best therapeutic decisions for their patients. I was part of the ML team, working on the SomaticNET project (a somatic variant calling tool using Siamese neural networks; a paper on it was presented at NeurIPS 2018). My work included unit-testing and refactoring a module within that project, as well as replicating a similar mutation detection project for benchmarking purposes. I also got to do other fun things like providing support at a genomics hackathon (Sudo Challenge, sudochallenge.com)

            I gained experience on: Docker, AWS, Linux terminal, PyTorch, Fastai, collaborative programming, testing, version control, continuous integration, bioinformatics file formats (BAM, BED, FASTA, VCF). I also substantially improved my knowledge of cancer biology and bioinformatics.

            Velocity IT is a business process automation company, offering digital transformation and business optimisation services by leveraging digital technologies. I was tasked with optimising a clientâ€™s process of making card payments. I worked in a team, designing, building and testing a robot that could automate the process of picking a card from a repository and performing two-factor authentication using a card reader. I created a program for reading the card reader screen using image processing (with OpenCV) and optical character recognition (OCR); all in Python. I programmed Arduino microcontrollers to enable various robotic functions. I also helped develop a chatbot (using certain Azure tools and C Sharp) for answering internal employee queries. Finally, I was responsible for promoting a business briefing event, hosted by Velocity.

            The Cardiff Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (CUROP) is a summer research programme. I developed computer vision software tools, capable of accurately recognising human activities in surveillance videos; everything was programmed in MATLAB. The process pipeline consisted of: low-level local Dense Trajectory Feature extraction, mid-level representation using Fisher Vectors, dimensionality reduction using PCA, action/activity recognition using Hidden Markov Models. I tested different configurations on surveillance datasets from literature, achieving comparable recognition accuracies. Also, I evaluated recognition performance for unknown actions and established recognition probability thresholds (anomaly detection). Finally, I presented a poster in the CUROP conference.
